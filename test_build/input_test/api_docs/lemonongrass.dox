\class Lemongrass
\brief Test class

Lemongrass is a test class to ensure two classes in one file can be documented. The following text to addHoliday()
and monthName() test auto linking methods.

These two will auto link: monthName(int value),  monthName(int)

This does not link, which is correct: monthName

The following link from a namespace should work: QSsl::someFunction()

*/


/*!
\var Lemongrass::howMuch

Documentation for a public variable.

*/


/*!
\fn int Lemongrass::addData(QString textA, float valueB)

capital R. This autolink should work: addHoliday()

@param valueB Documentation for the second received parameter
@param textA  Documentation for the first received parameter
@return Documentation for the return
