/**
\page makefile-test Makefile Test

The following test shows a new option in DoxPress for displaying a Makefile in a code block. The \c \\code command is
followed by a new parameter to indicate the source is a Makefile. There is currently no syntax highlighting since
Makefiles seldom require this.

The source code is placed inside a block structured like the following:

<pre>
   \\code {.mk}

      ... source goes here

   \\endcode
</pre>

<br>

\code {.mk}
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8.0 FATAL_ERROR)

cmake_policy(VERSION 3.8..3.13)
