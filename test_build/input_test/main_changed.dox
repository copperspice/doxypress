\page main-changed DoxyPress Improvements 

<ul>  
   <li>Default name for the <b>HTML Header</b> file was changed to doxy_header.html
      <ul>
         <li>The tag PROJECT NUMBER has been changed to PROJECT VERSION</li> 
      </ul>   
   </li>  
   <br>

   <li>Default name for the <b>HTML Footer</b> file was changed to doxy_footer.html</li> 
   <br><br>


   <li>Default name for the <b>HTML Stylesheet</b> was changed to doxy_style.css 
      <ul> 
         <li>The stylesheet 'doxy_style.css' is automatically included as the first CSS file</li>
         <li>To override styles, add one or more custom CSS files and specify them in the project configuration
             file under HTML STYLESHEETS</li>
         <li>Do not include 'doxy_style.css' in HTML STYLESHEETS or your custom style sheets</li>         
      </ul> 
   </li>
   <br>  
 

   <li>Default name for the <b>Page Layout</b> file was changed to doxy_layout.xml
      <ul> 
         <li>DoxyPress added several new sections to the layout format. If you were using a custom layout file we suggest generating
             a new layout file and then make any required custom changes to the new file</li>

         <li>The following table shows the tag names in the layout file which were changed</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
  
            
   <table>
      <tr><th width="250">Old Layout Values</th><th width="250">New Layout Values</th></tr>
      <tr>
         <td>$ALPHABETICAL_INDEX</td>
         <td>$ALPHA-INDEX</td>

   <li>Sorting pages in the <b>Tree View</b>
      <ul>
         <li>A new command has been added called \\sortid which takes one numeric parameter</li> 
         <li>This command can be added to any \\page which requires overriding the default sort order</li>
         <li>If this command is found DoxyPress will sort the pages based on the id number, otherwise pages will appear
             in the order they were processed</li>
      </ul>   
   </li>
