## DoxyPress

### Introduction

DoxyPress is a modern C++ application for generating documentation from annotated sources and API documentation.
DoxyPress and DoxyPressApp were initially derived from Doxygen and DoxyWizard.


###### Major enhancements

Parsing

* User selection for full parsing of C and C++ with clang in lieu of the legacy lex parser
* Clang parser allows complicated modern C++ to be parsed accurately, especially as C++ is updated
* Added a new parser for makefiles
* Documents the following computer languages: C, C++, Objective-C, C#, Fortran, Java, IDL, Python, PHP, and TCL

Classes and Containers

* DoxyPress links with the CopperSpice libraries
* Removed all Qt 2 classes and containers
* Refactored to use value based containers instead of pointer based containers
* For improved memory management variadic templates and shared pointers are used
* Source code reformatted for improved readability
* Modified source code to use modern C++ functionality, features, and syntax

Output

* Project file format enhanced to use a JSON format for improved functionality
* Command line option to convert Doxygen project files to the DoxyPress JSON format
* Enhanced layout file to include new sections
* Major improvements to the html output for correctness


### Building

DoxyPress prebuilt binaries are available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.

https://download.copperspice.com/doxypress/binary/

CMake build files are provided with the DoxyPress source distribution.

#### Dependencies
 * [CopperSpice](https://github.com/copperspice/copperspice). `CsCore` and `CsXml` are linked.
 * [LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#getting-the-source-code-and-building-llvm) Version 9+. For parsing using Clang.
   LLVM must be built with RTTI enabled (`-DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON`)
 * A C++17 compiler and standard library
